    kit "Damn I can't see anything."
    nar "Suddenly they all heard footsteps down below." 
    jay "Quiet..."
    nar "I whispered as I examined the alleyway below."
    vida "That is why we're up here, I guess."
    nar "She whispered to Kit." 
    nar "We looked down below as two figures walked around the corner talking to each other. We couldn't make out what they were saying but they seemed to be the authorities as one man wore a police cap."
    scene bg alleyway 2
    nar "The two men held flashlights and scanned them over the alley; it featured garbage and debris, all of which was covered in dried blood."
    nar "It was definitely the murder site. From what he could see from the flashlights, he didn't know how they would have seen without them, in the alley there was no corpse so the victim must have already been removed."
    nar "Even without it the whole scene sent shivers down my spine."
    nar "Kit leaned his head sideways attempting to hear what the men were saying deep below them. To avoid the disgusting scene below me and my friends I looked towards his left at the crossroad of the alley, and there was the sign Kit had mentioned."
    nar "Supposedly it had a sticker on it, though it was so dark out he couldn't tell."
    andrea "I think I can still smell it from here..."
    nar "I sniffled subtly and almost threw up. It smelled so bad."
    nar "I couldn't help but look down into the alley in search of the source of the smell, refusing to believe such a smell could come from such a cause."
    nar "As I tried to focus on the scene down below me I started to feel more sick and slowly everything became blurry as I stumbled backward before tripping causing me to fall onto my back."

    nar "The men in the alley shined their flashlights up towards the rooftop to the sound of Jay falling over. This let me see... something... in the sky, illuminated by the flashlights, before my eyes fully closed."
